sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

sudo apt-get install docker.io

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

newgrp docker

sudo snap install microk8s --classic

sudo microk8s status

mkdir ~/.kube

sudo microk8s kubectl config view --raw > ~/.kube/config

sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER

newgrp microk8s
